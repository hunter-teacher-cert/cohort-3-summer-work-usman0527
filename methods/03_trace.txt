CODE TRACING in the classroom
======================================


PROS:
---------------------------------------
<general positive aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
- Works as a great check for understanding (ed)
- "Think like a computer" has useful applications for debugging code (adam)
- Serves as a nice walkthrough of what happens at every step, aka procedural decomposition (mike)
- Useful outside of CS, showing thinking

CONS:
---------------------------------------
<general negative aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
- For code that is complex, the drawing would become very messy (usman)
- Diagrams can quickly get "undrawable" (ed)


BEST FOR:
---------------------------------------
<types of activities from courses you teach or have taught that could benefit from an emphasis on tracing>
- Teaching Loops
- Any iterative methods
- Teaching recursion, helping students acutally understand what is happening under the hood.
- debugging activities

LEAST-SUITED TO:
---------------------------------------
<opposite of above -- and why>
- When students do not know the syntax
- Introducing new topics
- super complex recursion
- program that is way to simple, i.e. print("hello world");


PROVEN PRO-TIPS:
---------------------------------------
<
 anything that has worked well for any member of your team, in the way of ...
 * live tracing ("trace-along" a la livecoding)
 * tracing as an assignment
 * tools, physical/online/otherwise that make it easier/clearer
 * etc 
>
- color coding
- showing different methods of diagraming, students pick the best for them
- remove computers from the equation
- Usman's Ipad. Good Notes

RESOURCES:
---------------------------------------
< any links, reading titles, names, etc. you have find useful >
- Good Notes
- Python Tutor for live tracing through the code. 

OTHER:
---------------------------------------
< anything you like, not already covered in prior prompts. >
